  In this work, we propose the strategies for designing radial graded sheet-based gyroid lattice and the approach to hybridizing solid-network-based gyroid lattice and primitive lattice. The elastic property of triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) sheet-based gyroid lattice structures was explored. We also conducted numerical analysis to investigate the effect of functionally graded sheet-based gyroid lattices on the implant application, and explored the elastic properties of the uniform gyroid lattice parametrically with different relative densities based on the representative volume element model. Analytical equations based on the Gibson-Ashby model were generated to predict the elastic properties. Compressive tests on the samples fabricated by the Stratasys J750 were conducted to validate the feasibility of applying hybridization of different types of lattices. A comparison between radial hybrid primitive-gyroid and gyroid-primitive lattices revealed that the compressive behavior of gyroid-primitive was strengthened. We also found that the gyroid-primitive lattice could achieve auxetic compressive behavior. In conclusion, the numerical analysis illustrates that the application of the functional graded gyroid lattices can relieve the stress shielding effect as well as protects the bone from damage. The hybridization of different lattices can not only strengthen the mechanical properties of TPMS structures but also create a counter-intuitive deformation response.
